# Targets-Shooter


## Description
This target shooter game is a simple 2d game where you have to shoot targets with a gun. 
It is a console based game that will be created in processing.
I want to include a start screen, a score counter, and an end screen if the player reaches the amount of targets needed.
Additionally, I would like to keep the display quite simple since overcomplicating a display will often distract the player resulting in them losing.
Along with this, I would like to give the player specific instructions on what to do when they win or lose this particular game.
Finally, it is visually stimulating game with high end graphics and handcrafted/original images.
